		<br>-1. Honey:<br>-The simplest way to breathe easily during an asthma attack is by holding a saucer filled with honey beneath the nose and inhaling the air. <br>-Also sipping hot water mixed with one teaspoon of honey just before going to bed would provide immense relief from the accumulation of phlegm in the throat.
        <br>--Garlic juice:-  A concoction made out of 15 drops of fresh extracted garlic juice and warm water can be taken internally for immediate relief.<br>- If you are experiencing early stages of asthma, drinking a cup of milk boiled with five cloves of garlic in the night would arrest the growth of the problem.<br>- Also a pinch of turmeric powder can be added in the milk while boiling.
        <br>-Vegetable juice: To keep asthma at bay, it is always a good practice to drink a glass of juice made out of one-third portion of spinach or radish, two-third portion of carrot and a dash of coriander juice, three times a day.
        <br>-Turmeric:  Also known as haldi, this evergreen herb is a very powerful medicine used in ayurveda for preparing several medicines. Consumption of half a teaspoon of turmeric powder with a teaspoon of honey provides good relief from bronchial congestion that shoots up during an asthma attack.
        <br>-Neem:  Ayurveda suggests medicinal benefits of neem in many of its remedial treatments.<br>- Consumption of few drop of neem oil on regular basis would go a long way in controlling the ill effects of asthma.
